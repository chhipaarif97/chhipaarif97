# Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Arif Chhipa
- I am an analytical and committed cybersecurity professional-in-training passionate about protecting data, systems, and people from evolving digital threats. I bring a solid understanding of core security principles—such as the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad—and hands-on experience with tools like SIEM (e.g., Splunk), IDS, packet sniffers, and incident response frameworks.
- My technical strengths include implementing critical security controls, conducting threat analysis, and supporting automation using Python and SQL. I value integrity, continuous learning, and proactive risk management, which are principles guiding my personal development and professional contributions. I am also well-versed in compliance frameworks, including PCI DSS and NIST CSF, recognizing their vital role in reducing risk and aligning IT practices with business objectives.
- Cybersecurity appeals to me because it combines critical thinking with real-world impact. I thrive in environments where protecting assets and supporting secure innovation are priorities. Currently preparing through the CISSP’s eight domains, I’m building the breadth and depth needed to help organizations reduce vulnerabilities, respond to incidents effectively, and foster a resilient security culture.
- By aligning my technical skills, ethical values, and curiosity-driven mindset, I am prepared to support an organization’s mission to safeguard its digital environment, protect stakeholder trust, and ensure operational continuity in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.
- Conducted a comprehensive security audit for Botium Toys, evaluating technical and physical security controls along with compliance to frameworks like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC. Identified key vulnerabilities in areas such as least privilege enforcement, encryption, IDS deployment, disaster recovery planning, and password policy management. Delivered a set of actionable recommendations, including:

       Implementation of the separation of duties and encryption protocols

       Deployment of an intrusion detection system (IDS)

       Introduction of a password management system

       Establishment of legacy system monitoring procedures

       Proper asset classification to uncover additional security gaps

- This audit significantly enhanced the company’s security posture and laid the foundation for improved regulatory compliance and operational resilience.
